This project is the implementation of a talk given at the Selenium Conference 2012 in London. 

When configured properly, it will generate a set of Selenium Page Objects for use in automated test scripts. These
pages will allow you to "absorb" changes made to the product under test, by analyzing the presentation layer and reflecting
changes in this Page Object model.

There are two projects in this repository. The TastyMonster project is the Automation Framework, while the PatentMojo project
is an example web-app, which will hopefully grow in sophistication over time. 

For now, play around, enjoy, and remember--the concept is sound, as demonstrated on a major commercial web-app. This project
is initially meant to provide more ideas than implementation, but we hope to make it grow over time into a real specification.

As word gets out about the power of this concept, we hope this project will serve as a beacon of unified terminology and process,
allowing us to push for better change control within the industry.
